## HRConnect

HRConnect enables HR officers to efficiently organise applicants based on the hiring process and streamlines recruitment
through filtering of applicants and ease of contact management with CLI commands.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
